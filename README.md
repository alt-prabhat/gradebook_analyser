# GradeBook Analyzer CLI

> Command-line gradebook assistant for quick mark analysis and reporting.

## 1. Project Overview
The script helps lecturers enter or import student marks, run core statistics, assign letter grades, and export a tidy report.

## 2. Features
- **Two data entry modes** – type marks manually or import from a `.csv` file.
- **Class statistics** – average, median, highest score (with student), and lowest score (with student).
- **Automatic grading** – assigns letter grades (A–F) based on score thresholds.
- **Grade distribution** – counts how many students earned each letter grade.
- **Pass / fail filter** – list comprehension separates students using a configurable pass mark (default 40).
- **Tabbed summary table** – prints every student with marks and grade in a clean, tab-separated layout.
- **Optional CSV export** – save the generated report to a new file directly from the CLI.

## 3. Repository Structure
```
gradebook_analyser/
├── gradebook.py
├── students.csv        # example input (optional)
└── final_report.csv    # created when you export results (optional)
```

## 4. Setup & Usage
1. **Download** or clone this repository.
2. **Open a terminal** in the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd gradebook_analyser
   ```
3. **Run the program**:
   ```bash
   python gradebook.py
   ```
4. **Follow the on-screen menu** to choose:
   - `1` – **Manual Entry**: enter student names and marks interactively.
   - `2` – **CSV Import**: load marks from a CSV file in the same folder.
   - `Q` – Quit the application.

### CSV Format Guide
If you import data, make sure your file looks like this (no headers required but supported):
```csv
Name,Mark
Rohan Kumar,88
Priya Sharma,92
Amit Patel,58
```
Marks outside 0–100 or non-numeric values are skipped with a warning so you can fix them later.
